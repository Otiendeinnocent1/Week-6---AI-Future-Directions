Q1. Edge AI vs Cloud AI

Edge AI processes data locally on devices (smartphones, IoT sensors, Raspberry Pi) instead of sending it to distant cloud servers.

Reduced latency: Processing near the source avoids delays caused by network transmission. This is critical in autonomous systems like drones or self-driving cars,
where milliseconds can determine safety.

Enhanced privacy: Sensitive data (like faces in a smart home camera) never leaves the device, lowering exposure to cyber risks.

Example: DJI drones with onboard AI chips detect obstacles in real time without relying on cloud servers.

Q2. Quantum AI vs Classical AI

Classical AI relies on binary computing and heuristic algorithms to solve optimization problems, but struggles with large-scale complexity.

Quantum AI leverages qubits and quantum parallelism to explore multiple solutions simultaneously, drastically improving optimization speed.

Industries benefiting most:

Finance: portfolio optimization.

Pharma/Healthcare: quantum drug discovery.

Logistics: route optimization for supply chains.


Q3. Human–AI Collaboration in Healthcare

Human–AI collaboration augments rather than replaces healthcare professionals.

Radiologists: AI assists in detecting anomalies in scans faster, while radiologists interpret context and patient history.

Nurses: AI chatbots and triage systems handle routine tasks, freeing nurses for compassionate, hands-on care.

Impact: Improves efficiency, reduces diagnostic errors, and enables more personalized care delivery.


Case Study Critique – AI in Smart Cities

Integration Benefits:

IoT + AI in traffic management enables adaptive signal control, reducing congestion and emissions.

Urban sustainability improves through fuel savings and better air quality.

Challenges:

Data Security: Vulnerability to hacking of IoT-enabled infrastructure.

Interoperability: Different IoT devices and vendors may struggle to communicate effectively.
