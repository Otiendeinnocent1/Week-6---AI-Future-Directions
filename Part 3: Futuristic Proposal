AI Application 2030: AI-Powered Climate Engineering

Problem: Global warming and extreme climate events.

Workflow:

Inputs: Satellite imagery, IoT climate sensors, atmospheric data.

Model: Reinforcement Learning for dynamic simulations of geoengineering interventions (e.g., aerosol injection, cloud seeding).

Outputs: Predictive models on climate impact, safe intervention strategies.

Benefits: Potential to prevent catastrophic climate tipping points.

Risks: Ethical concerns about unintended ecological effects, governance disputes, and over-reliance on AI for planetary-scale decisions.

Bonus Task

Quantum Circuit Example (IBM Quantum Experience):

Code: Create a 3-qubit superposition & apply Grover’s Algorithm for faster search.

AI Optimization Use: Drug discovery – instead of brute-force molecular simulation, quantum circuits find candidate compounds faster.
