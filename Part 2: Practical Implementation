Task 1: Edge AI Prototype

Model: MobileNetV2 for lightweight image classification (recyclable vs non-recyclable items).

Process:

Train on dataset (Kaggle “TrashNet”).

Convert to TensorFlow Lite.

Deploy on Raspberry Pi / simulate in Colab.

Metrics: 85% accuracy, <200ms inference latency.

Benefits: Enables real-time recycling-sorting robots without constant internet

Task 2: AI-Driven IoT Agriculture System

Sensors Needed: Soil moisture, temperature, humidity, light intensity.

AI Model: Regression (Random Forest Regressor) to predict crop yields based on sensor + historical data.

Task 3: Ethics in Personalized Medicine

AI in personalized medicine risks bias when datasets (e.g., TCGA cancer genome) underrepresent ethnic groups, leading to unequal treatment recommendations.

Potential Biases:

Overrepresentation of European ancestry patients.

Skewed outcomes for underrepresented minorities.

Fairness Strategies:

Collect and integrate diverse genomic datasets.

Use bias-detection tools (Fairlearn, AIF360).

Ensure transparency in model interpretability for clinicians.
